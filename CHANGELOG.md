# Changelog

All notable changes to Pi Session Manager will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documented Prime native-session links, source filters, RLM/IPython rendering, public release installers, and the local read-only server mode.
- **OMP (oh-my-pi) session support** — the Pi fork's sessions (`~/.omp/agent/sessions`) are now scanned, parsed, and shown with their own source badge/icon alongside Pi and other external agents
  - Added `Omp` to the backend provider registry (`ProviderKind` / `SessionBridgeSource`) with `omp --session` resume and `~/.omp/...` session roots
  - Added `omp` binary to export command candidates
  - Added OMP source detection, AgentIcon (from the omp icon.svg), i18n strings, and resume-target support in the frontend

### Changed

- Reworked the English and Chinese READMEs around Prime-Agent as the default runtime while preserving explicit MIT attribution to Pi Session Manager and Dwsy.
- Pointed CLI/desktop installers, updater channels, release metadata, website download links, and repository tooling at `dat-lequoc/prime-agent-session-manager`.
- Added public release download support without falling back to the upstream project.
